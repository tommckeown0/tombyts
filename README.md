Personal Netflix app!

I want to be able to stream my personal media to any device at home (and potentially across the internet in the future).

This involves:
- A backend server with routes and the ability to serve media requests.
- A frontend web UI for use on PC with user registration and accounts.
- A database to store user credentials and user watch data (what have they watched, what time are they at in a certain movie etc.).
- An app for use on Android phones and TV (possibly iOS but I don't have any devices with apple software).

Backend is built with NodeJS
Frontend is React
Database is MongoDB

Recreating this because I want to use TypeScript
